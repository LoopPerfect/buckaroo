## Getting Help

If you need quick interaction, a good avenue for talking to the developers is [Gitter.im](https://gitter.im/LoopPerfect/buckaroo). If you have a complex problem, reporting an issue is the best route.


## Reporting Issues

Since Buckaroo has a few different components, it is important that issues are reported in the right place.

 * Report **issues with a specific recipe** to the [buckaroo-recipes issue tracker](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo-recipes/issues).
 * Report **package requests** to the [buckaroo-wishlist](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo-wishlist/issues).
 * Report **feature requests** to the [buckaroo issue tracker](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/issues).

If you are not sure, just report to the [buckaroo issue tracker](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/issues).  üòå

### Security

If you have a sensitive issue, such as a security bug, please send an email to security@buckaroo.pm.


## Making a Contribution

The procedure for contributing to Buckaroo is:

 1. Fork [LoopPerfect/buckaroo](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo) on GitHub
 2. Make some changes, adding unit-tests where appropriate
 3. Ensure that all tests pass
 4. Make a pull request (usually to `master`)
 5. Bask in the kudos! üëèüëë


## What should I work on?

We endeavor to keep [the issue tracker](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/issues) up-to-date, so that is the best place to start. Keep an eye out for [issues marked "help wanted"](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/labels/help%20wanted).

### First-time Contributor ‚ù§Ô∏è

First-time contributor? Take a look at the issue tracker for [issues marked "first commit"](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/labels/first%20commit) for smaller, self-contained tasks. We would also be happy to walk you through any of the existing code on [Gitter.im](https://gitter.im/LoopPerfect/buckaroo).

### Recipes

Another way to contribute is by writing recipes! Send a PR to [this repo](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo-recipes) to add a recipe to the official cookbook. If you are looking for a library to port, [the wishlist](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo-wishlist) is a good place to start.

### Your Own Feature

If you would like to contribute a feature that you have thought of, please [create an issue](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/issues) first so that we can ensure the design is in-keeping with the general direction of Buckaroo.


## Environment

Development of Buckaroo requires a [Buck](https://buckbuild.com) installation on your system. We would also recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for its code-completion features.

To fetch the source-code:

```bash=
git clone https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo.git
cd buckaroo
```

To build the project:

```bash=
buck build :buckaroo
```

To run the project:

```bash=
buck build :buckaroo-cli
```

To build the Debian bundle you will need `equivs`: 

```bash=
sudo apt install -y equivs
```

### IntelliJ IDEA

To generate IntelliJ IDEA project files:

```bash=
buck project --ide intellij
```

Due to a bug in Buck, you may need to manually mark the `main/resources` folder as a resource folder in IntelliJ IDEA. To do this, right-click on the folder in the `Project` pane, choose `Mark Directory as` and then `Resources Root`.

### Which branch should I use? ü§î

The convention for branches in Buckaroo is:

 * `master` - the very latest code with the latest features, but not recommended for production use
 * `release/version` - the branch from which a release version is tagged
 * `bugfix/bug` - a branch for fixing a specific bug
 * `feature/widget` - a branch for implementing a specific feature
 * `improvement/widget` - a branch for making a specific improvement, such as refactoring

Most developers should branch from `master` in order to have their changes included in the next release.

If you would like to patch an old release, you should branch off of `release/version`.


## Testing

Buckaroo uses automated testing and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/LoopPerfect/buckaroo) to prevent regressions.

There are two `buck test` targets for Buckaroo:

 * `buckaroo-unit` is for self-contained tests of interal logic to Buckaroo.
 * `buckaroo-integration` is for tests that require external services, such as GitHub.

To run the tests:

```bash=
buck test :buckaroo-unit
buck test :buckaroo-integration
```

You can also run these tests inside IntelliJ IDEA.

### Adding a Test

First, determine if your test belongs in `buckaroo-unit` or `buckaroo-integration`. A test in `buckaroo-unit` must not modify the file system or call any external services. Favour `buckaroo-unit` tests where possible.

Next, place your test in the right directory:

 * `buckaroo-unit` tests live under `src/test/java/com/loopperfect/buckaroo`.
 * `buckaroo-integration` tests live under `src/integration/java/com/loopperfect/buckaroo`.


## Making a Pull Request

Once your submission is ready, you should make a pull request on GitHub to the appropriate branch.

 * If you are implementing a new feature or bug-fix for the next release, then you should `base` your pull request on `master`.

 * If you are making a bug-fix for an old release, you should `base` on the appropriate `release/version` branch.

We review pulls request within 24 hours.


## Releases

Buckaroo releases are semantically versioned Git tags. You can see [the releases on GitHub](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/releases).

Each release has a corresponding branch named `release/version`. This allows `master` to progress beyond the current release, whilst still allowing for easy patching of old versions.

### Installing a Cutting-edge Release ‚úã‚ö†Ô∏è

If you would like to use the latest version of Buckaroo from `master`, then you can do this using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [Linuxbrew](http://linuxbrew.sh/):

```bash=
brew install --HEAD loopperfect/lp/buckaroo
```
